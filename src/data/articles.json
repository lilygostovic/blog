        "text": "First of all, I would like to say HI! And thank you for reading my blog. I am Lily and this is what I like to think of as my virtual diary. Here, you’ll find my thoughts, from the rawest form, all the way to texts carefully put together word by word. Although this version of my diary won’t have all the juicy details that my personal journal does (I can’t fully expose myself to the entirety of the internet, a girl needs to have at least a few secrets), it’ll have some of my purest thoughts that I believe won’t incriminate me if read by anyone from my personal FBI agent, to my parents.|Now that you know a little about my diary and what this strange website that you have stumbled across even is, I can tell do what I love the most and tell the world who I am!|I’ve grown up in the same semi-detached house in Toronto all my life. I went to primary school (which I have always called public school although that seems to confuse people…) a half block south of my house. Growing up, I spent the majority of my weekends with my best friend (who lived in the house attached to mine, I know, every kids dream, I was pretty lucky!) making videostars and playing the Sims Freeplay on my family’s iPad. I like to believe that growing up on my street was the best thing any kid could ask for. There was a gang of about 15 or so kids who lived within a one block radius, again, any kids dream! Our close proximity in both age and living made for loads of fun summer weekends running around our neighbourhood playing cops and robbers, curby, or really any game we could dream of barefoot for the entirety of the day.|As we grew older, and our paths began to slightly diverge from one another, I stopped seeing the neighbourhood gang as much. Although I haven’t spoken with many of them in recent years, I know that we will always have a bond no other could contest.|Moving on from what I remember as being a perfect childhood, the next chapter of my life was high school. I have recently graduated (if you can even call it that in quarantine) from Ursula Franklin Academy after what felt like four very short years. High school definitely had lots of ups and downs, many more than from what I can remember of any other chapter of my life. My sheer abundance of time in quarantine has given me the time to think back on high school as a whole in a way I have never truly been able to before. Sometimes when I think back on high school I tend to focus on all the drama that seemed to consume the last year and a half of my life in high school while almost totally forgetting the best parts. Although there were some overly dramatic days throughout high school, there were so many days that I never fully appreciated for how amazing they were. I will really truly miss almost every bit of life in high school. From sitting outside under the sun on the front picnic benches (probably being spied on by Barbara), to ridiculous but hilarious Wednesday sessions, to parties that brought everyone together for once, to late nights in McDonalds after whatever had came earlier, I’ll really miss it all.|Now, while living through a global pandemic, I am reflecting on what’s to come. Whether that is going to McGill for Arts like I am planned to do, or deferring my offer and taking a gap year, I am unsure. Whether the spark currently lit in me of being an au pair will turn into a roaring fire or whither out with time, I am unsure. Whether I will have the courage to take a gap year and go into the unknown, I am unsure. All I can say now for sure is that I am excited to see where the future takes me next year because I have a feeling it’ll be something entirely new. New is always a reason to be excited.|I guess the above didn’t really cover all the usual points a biography usually does… so here are a couple of quick fun facts about me!\nI am a morning person!!! I am very happy (, energetic, hyper, and high energy) in the morning which can tire people who aren’t\nSkiing has forever been my favourite sport and will always have a very special place in my heart\nAlthough… I now consider rugby to be my favourite sport. Probably just because it is so awesome and fun and empowering and the best!\nI am very organized and plan for just about everything in my life\nEven though I am good at school, my common knowledge lacks which makes games like trivia and scrabble extra difficult for me\nI work at a candy store which amazes just about every little kid I meet"

        "text": "In a few sentences:|Essaouira is an absolutely beautiful city that turned me into a beach bum! It is an incredible city in all aspects, from its friendly people, to its endless beaches. It has a very cute, cozy feel that compares to no other city I have ever visited. After spending only three days in the city, I promised myself that I would put aside a chunk of my future to live there and fully experience the relaxed life that Essaouira provides.|First day in Essaouira:|After a late night out clubbing in Marrakech, mum and I woke up to the alarm that I had set way too loud just three hours before. We managed to crawl out the front doors of La Mamounia (thank god for the gentlemen who’s job it is to open the doors or we might not have made it out at all) and into the comfy car waiting outside.|The moment I slipped into the car, I was back asleep. I finally woke up about two and a half hours later just as we were getting into Essaouira. To quote my journal exactly, my first impression of the city was “SO BEAUTIFUL”. Mum and I couldn’t stop talking about how beautiful each little detail was on the drive into town; from the moroccan flags that lined the roads, to the perfectly groomed flowers at the centre of each roundabout and the sides of each road, it was all perfectly groomed to be absolutely stunning.|Overhearing our enthusiasm about the beauty, our driver, Mustafa, explained that the King had recently been in Essaouira and that we missed him by only a few days. Mustafa told us that anywhere the King goes in Morocco is always cleaned and touched up so it is freshly beautiful for him. No matter how short of a notice the town gets, they will spend all their energy on cleaning and renovating until he arrives. The preparations don’t end there. People all across the country put up flag posts and hang Moroccan flags lining any road the King might drive on to reach his destination. The amount of work that was done by the city was breathtaking.|The love that Moroccans feel towards their king is unlike anything I had ever seen; incredibly strong, completely unconditional, and very touching to an outsider.|After checking into our hotel, mum and I walked down to the beach. I wish you could feel how soft the sand on the beach was, it was unlike any other beach I can remember. Despite it being the middle of January there were lots of locals out doing their thing on the beach. There was a game of beach volleyball between some of the local boys that brought the edge of the beach to life with their carefree and happy aura. A sea of kitesurfers filled the ocean who, unlike me, were probably very grateful for the windy day it was. A little further down the beach there were guys were doing muscle ups on a bar they’d made. Something that stood out to me was a pair of young boys who looked like they were choreographing some sort of fight scene that almost looked like a street performance.|Of all the things I saw on the beach that first day in Essaouira, the craziest thing I saw was by far were the camels and horses for rent at the far end of the beach. There were dozens and dozens of camels tied up everywhere, waiting to rented for a ride. Their familiar yet completely alien shape and way of being blew my mind. It took me a while to fully realize that what I was seeing was real.|Second day in Essaouira:|Our second day in Essaouira started with a tour from the General Manager (GM) at Heure Bleu (the hotel that we were staying at). During our tour, the GM pridefully told us that the King had stayed at Heure Bleu during his visit. It was a really big deal that the King stayed at Heure Bleu since whenever the King visits somewhere, he will stay at one of his palaces. It is very rare for the King to stay in a hotel, so this was clearly a very big deal for the GM, as well as all the staff who got to tend to him. Everyone that we spoke with seemed to be very honoured that they were so close and even got to serve the King. The hotel had been completely privatized for his stay which the GM noted was very stressful for him as he had to find new accommodations for all the guests that planned on staying there. The hotel had been completely renovated and prepared for the King in four days (the short amount of notice they were given).|After our tour, mum and I walked around town and did some shopping. It was reliving how easy it was to shop in Essaouira compared to Marrakech. Shopping in Marrakech was almost too stressful to be productive. Being in a busy, bustling environment where people are all in your face and trying to pressure you into buying things for the first time was quite overwhelming for me. The contrast of the laid-back and calm vibe that Essaouira stores gave me made it much easier (almost too easy) for me to spend my money.|After our nice long walk exploring town, we still had some time before our dinner reservation so we decided to treat ourselves to another hammam (check out this article where I explain my first experience in a hammam). What an incredible way to end my stay in Essaouira.|Final Remarks:|Essaouira definitely stole a piece of my heart during my short visit. It’s beautiful landscapes and soundtrack of crashing waves made it feel like home as soon as I got there. I can’t wait for the day I can call it home."

        "text": "I loved the Jersey Shore! What I initially thought was going to be a trashy, boring beach vacation turned out to be one of the highlights of my summer. The Jersey Shore had a quiet beach, booming boardwalk, and huge playful waves that somehow made me actually enjoy my time on the beach. Oh, and not to mention the awesome company helped too!|I would like to start this post by making it clear to everyone that I am not a beach person. I love swimming, love lakes, love pools, and rivers, but the beach has just never been my scene. There’s something about the sand, the salt water, and the scary ocean animals that I prefer to avoid.|I had a lot of preconceived notions about the Jersey Shore. The only connotation I had with it was trashy (which originated from my opinion on the 2009 reality show Jersey Shore). To be honest, when my mom announced that we were going to be heading to the Jersey Shore for the summer, my snobby, European-beach-preferring self was a little bit disappointed.|This foul perspective of the trip quickly dissipated when we got there and explored a little bit.|Our Air B&B wasn’t ready when we got there so we decided to kill some time exploring the board walk. When I walked out onto the boardwalk I was so surprised. There were restaurants of all different kinds of vibes; from hawaiian styles, to diners, to classy bistros, it seemed like there was a little of everything! There were also adorable take out restaurants along the boardwalk built in shipping containers which I thought was an adorable, thrifty, and so unique idea.|It was early afternoon and the beach was booming! There were people tanning, swimming, playing volleyball, and touch rugby (!!!! the sight of this instantly won my heart over). Even with all the people, there was still lots of room on the beach for more people. Since the beach is so long, there was plenty of room for everyone, unlike Hollywood Beach in Florida where it feels like it’s impossible to find a tiny corner of the beach at any time of day.|My first impression of the beach was great. I knew I would have a good time even though I went in with a slightly negative mindset.|Our days on the Jersey Shore were exactly what you imagine any beach vacation to be like. We had a light breakfast, spent the morning on the beach, grabbed a quick bite to eat from one of the food stands (in shipping containers, don’t forget) then spent the rest of the afternoon. Somehow, it was perfect.|I can’t speak for other parts of the Jersey Shore, but Asbury Park has a really cool huge old building that had been converted into a mini mall. It has incredibly high ceilings and windows all along the walls. For a girl who loves to shop, it was perfect for me!|The Jersey Shore, specifically Asbury Park, has a hipster feel unlike other beaches I’ve been to. I loved hanging out on the beach, swimming in the huge waves (which by the way, before this trip I hardly ever went past my knees in the ocean), shopping in the outdoor feeling mall, and eating at the cute boardwalk restaurants or food stands!|The Jersey Shore somehow converted me from someone who avoided the beach when possible to someone who would actually spend money to go back there! That goes to show how much I actually enjoyed the Jersey Shore!!"

        "text": "After a tiring morning of reading and a draining workout, I find myself curled up in bed in my softest pyjamas and fuzzy blanket, drifting in and out of sleep. This morning I finally finished reading All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr, the fourth novel or memoir that I have read about WW2. Given the circumstances of the world and all the loss of hope I am already feeling due to covid, I promised myself that the next book that I pick up will be a lighter, more enjoyable read. Rather than another educational yet heart-wrenching book about war. After finishing my book, I decided it was time for a workout. I consulted my newly made quarantine training schedule, filled my water bottle, laced up my running shoes and headed to a nearby track to run sprints. I won’t get in to the specifics of repeat 400s because I don’t want to make you uneasy, however, the least you must know is that they are by far, the most difficult workout possibly ever. Although very satisfying when finished, extremely difficult to actually finish. I returned home, sweaty as can be, and finished my workout off with 30 minutes of Pamela Reif’s Ab workout. Yes, the same one that still has my abs sore from a workout I did three days ago. Finally, around two o’clock, after a shower and a huge plate of barley salad, I make my way up to my room, curl up in bed and place upon myself the task of choosing a new book to read.|Dozens and dozens of book descriptions pass over my eyes, yet nothing stands out. Just when I have lost all hope that I’ll find a new book to read today, dad shows up with seven books he’s hauled up from my parents’ enormous bookshelf planted firmly against the far basement wall. Of all the descriptions he unknowingly assigns to the seven books, one, he remembers, was a very light read and has a very nice story. That description perfectly matched what I was looking for so I decided to give it a try.|Sitting upright, determined not to fall asleep while reading as I so often do, I open my new book, Eleanor Rigby, by Douglas Coupland and begin to read. As the pages go by, I feel myself slowly inching downward, less and less upright. Eventually, I realize I have reached complete horizontality with my head gently resting on one of many throw pillows. Convincing myself that I feel fine, and that I am not at all tired, I allow myself to stay in the position I slowly fell into. Pages go by, flipping, and turning. Sentence and after sentence flows through my mind like water flowing through a long, thin stream to no end. I feel my mind relaxing, taking in the words as my eyes start to flutter closed. Gently, I place my book onto my floral bedspread and give in. The pure exhaustion of this mornings’ activities battles with the sunlight pouring in through my open windows, pulling me away from my book, my bed, my fuzzy pyjamas and blankets. Deeper and deeper, exhaustion pulls me, until I have ultimately drifted off into a light slumber. I wake with the sun gently warming my face, not having a clue as to how much time has passed. My brain begins to bully my body, reasoning that the daylight I being wasted, and that there are better, more productive things to do than lay lazily in bed. A little voice in my head reasons with my brain and convinces it to let me sleep just a little longer. I roll over, shielding my eyes from the warm sun’s rays and allow myself to relax again. Laying there, I find the beautiful in between of being awake and being asleep. I roll gently in my fuzzy blanket, perhaps the softest material in the world. I lay my face in patches of sunlight until its warmth is no longer bearable. My face finds new, cool areas on the mountain of pillows I have created to nestle itself into. My arms and legs gently find new areas of my bed, stretching out my tired muscles, all the while staying wholly covered by my blanket.|If the time I spent drifting in and out of sleep this afternoon was not the definition of complete bliss, then I am not sure if I am ready to find out what is."
